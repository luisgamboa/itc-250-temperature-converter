# itc-172-temperature-converter

For our first group project we'll be  building a PHP application that converts temperatures based on user input.

The application must:

Convert at least 3 temperature types, for example Fahrenheit to Celcius, Celcius to Fahrenheit and Fahrenheit to Kelvin.
Disallow incorrect data and provide feedback, for example, when a user inputs a string, the data is not processed and the user is informed of the mistake.
Be built as nearly as possible to PSR-1 (Links to an external site.) and PSR-2 (Links to an external site.) standards
Project Document: Besides a working application, you must also show your program design pieces visually on a project document shared by your team and also with my email: williamnewman@gmail.com

Visual Elements Required: Your program design document should identify an IPO chart and a flowchart of how the application will operate and process data.
